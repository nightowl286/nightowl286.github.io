            <p>Hello, I'm Nightowl, <i>(god I hate writing about me sections, always feels weird to introduce myself).</i></p>

                  I'm a programmer, and I quite like programming, although there were times in my life when I hated it.
                  Overall I think I like creating things <i>(especially when it's something I think is cool)</i>,
                  and exploring new and different ways to do things <i>(which tends to get some people worked up)</i>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I suffer from a sleep disorder/disability known as
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder" title="Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder">N24</a>
                  <i>(the symptoms of which make my username quite ironic)</i>, it makes life both extremely
                  painful but also interesting, peaceful and beautiful <i>(so many sunsets and sunrises)</i>.

            <h2>Wishlist</h2>
            <p>
               The wishlist is a collection of programs that I really want to make,
               primarily because I think it'll be really cool to have them.

               <p>
                  A project to create the best offline music player,
                  initially inspired simply because shuffle algorithms suck.

               <p>
                  A project to create a new kind of an IDE, a 'transforming' IDE that is meant to adapt to workflows,
                  instead of being general or specialised for single language.

                  A project to create a local project manager, CI/CD pipeline, basically anything I'd
