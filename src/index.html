                     I'm a programmer, and I quite like programming, although there were times in my life when I hated it.
                     Overall I think I like creating things <i>(especially when it's something I think is cool)</i>,
                     and exploring new and different ways to do things <i>(which tends to get some people worked up)</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I think it's extremely fun to try out new ways of doing things, usually I find that most things
                     end up not being as good as they could be, simply because they are being held back either by
                     tech debt, no commercial use/support, or people simply not willing to change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I suffer from a sleep disorder/disability known as
                     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder">
                        <abbr title="Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder">N24</abbr>
                     </a>
                     <i>(the symptoms of which make my username quite ironic)</i>, it makes life both extremely
                     painful but also interesting, peaceful and beautiful <i>(so many sunsets and sunrises)</i>.

               <p>
                  The wishlist is a collection of programs that I really want to make,
                  primarily because I think it'll be really cool to make them
                  <i>(even if they do already exists)</i>.

                     A project to create the best offline music player,
                     initially inspired simply because shuffle algorithms suck.

                     A project to create a new kind of an IDE, a 'transforming' IDE that is meant to adapt to workflows,
                     instead of being general or specialised for single language.
