   <summary>create a new kind of an IDE, a 'transforming' IDE that is meant to adapt to workflows, instead of being general or specialised for a single language.</summary>

		IDEs are an integral part of programming and development, sure some people say that you don't need them,
		you could just open up a very primitive text editor, and use a <abbr title="Command-line interface">CLI</abbr>
		for building and/or running your program, but you're just gonna hate yourself for it
		<thought>(unless you enjoy the pain of course)</thought>. And to those people, I say that they've clearly never
		used a proper specialised <abbr title="Integrated development environment">IDE</abbr> that made it a pleasure
		to program.

			Specialised IDEs are great, and when used instead of a general IDE, they make it feel
			as if your tooling has just took a deep breathe of fresh air and it came back to life.

		<section id="specialised-the-good" title="The good">
			Specialised IDEs as the name suggests, are indeed specialised. Typically for a single language.
			Which means that the development process can end up feeling much much much more polished,
			streamlined, and exactly what you want for working with that language.

			The entire experience will usually get a big boost, along with having extra tooling that is
			relevant for working with the language that the IDE is aimed at,
			<thought>(Such as profiling tools, testing tools, live previews for documents, e.t.c).</thought>
		</section>
		<section id="specialised-and-the-bad" title="And the bad">
			However, specialised IDEs take a lot of time and effort to make, and so a good quality one is
			unfortunately rare to come by, and somewhat surprisingly, it seems that a lot of more niche languages
			end up having some sort of a specialised IDE, <thought>(usually a low quality one)</thought>, that was written
			by either the developers of the language, or by one of the fans, or the community.

			And it's great to see that the thought was there, however usually those IDEs are written by people
			who haven't ever written an IDE before, who's passion isn't the IDE, but the language that they made,
			and the IDE is just something they see as a necessity.

			In the end however, the worst part about specialised IDEs is probably that they end up being so
			different from each other, without offering any sort of coherent design. They also make it hard to switch away
			from them, or learn a language that they don't support, simply because you're so used to them and
			learning a new IDE ends up being quite challenging.

		<section id="specialised-visual-studio" title="Visual Studio">
			As a C# programmer that used to use <abbr title="A steaming pile of doo doo">Windows</abbr>,
			my experience with specialised IDEs primarily consists of
			<abbr title="An IDE that supports several languages, but mainly focuses on good C# experience">Visual Studio</abbr>.
			And in my experience, <abbr title="Short for Visual Studio">VS</abbr> did quite a good job.

			There were of course times where it absolutely sucked so god damn much
			<thought>(I'm looking at you VS 2019 - *insert angry man shouting at clouds*)</thought>,
			however overall I've had much more positive experiences with it than bad ones, everything just worked as it should.

			It's downside however, is that it's Windows only, and Windows sucks
			<thought>(for several large reasons that have nothing to do with this article)</thought>,
			so I switched away from it.

		<section id="specialised-rider" title="JetBrains Rider">
			If you're in the C# space, then you're going to be recommended to either use
			<abbr title="Visual Studio">VS</abbr>, or <abbr title="JetBrains Rider">Rider</abbr>.
			VS being the Windows-only one that has a free community edition along with paid enterprise versions,
			and Rider being the cross-platform one that, that has paid version and a
			<thought>(very questionable)</thought> free version.

			My experience with Rider is in fact quite limited, and maybe it has improved since I've tried it out,
			however my very first experience with it left an incredibly bad impression, it's key binds
			<thought>(which it said it imported from VS)</thought> didn't work as expected, the auto-hide panel feature
			that I was incredibly used to in VS just didn't work, there wasn't an easy way to switch between project
			configurations like there was in VS <thought>(but I'm told that feature was now added)</thought>.

			And overall, I just really didn't like it's UI and UX.

			In my opinion, general IDEs are a wishful idea, and in a perfect world they might have ended up
			being the best option. However, from my experience, I never wanted to burn anything to the ground so badly before.
		</content>
		<section id="general-the-good" title="The good">
			In all fairness, the idea behind general IDEs is a solid one: focus on making a good text editor, that can then
			be easily configured and upgraded with extensions written by the community.

			They can support virtually any language that exists out there, as long as someone is willing to make an extension for it,
			meaning that you can keep on using the same IDE that you've become used to for developing different things.

			Another good part of general IDEs, is that if you're using an extension for something, and you don't like it,
			then you can just switch to a different extension, or even make one yourself.
		</section>
		<section id="general-and-the-bad" title="And the bad">
			However, in reality <thought>(at least from my experience)</thought>, what ends up happening is that
			you get a plethora of lacklustre extensions <thought>(rarely are there any good ones)</thought>, along
			with an IDE that you have to configure in weird ways that lack polish.

			Along with that, in my experience the extensions don't work together as well as they could, for example spellchecking,
			with code this can be difficult to get correctly, as there are several places that should be spellchecked, and some places
			that shouldn't ever be spellchecked, and some where it depends on the context. And typically a good spellchecker will need
			to have decent integration with whatever programming language you're using, at least so that it can understand the
			structure of the code file. Because this isn't as simple as "spellcheck all comments", because in some languages
			<thought>(such as in C#)</thought>, you have documentation comments that use XML markup, and obviously neither
			the XML tags themselves, nor the attributes should be spellchecked
			<thought>(here I mean the name of the attribute itself, whether the value should be spellchecked is more contextual)</thought>.
			Only the content of <em>some</em> elements should be spellchecked.
