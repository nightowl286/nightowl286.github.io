<project name="Transform">
   <summary>create a new kind of an IDE, a 'transforming' IDE that is meant to adapt to workflows, instead of being general or specialised for a single language.</summary>
	<content>
		IDEs are an integral part of programming and development, sure some people say that you don't need them,
		you could just open up a very primitive text editor, and use a <abbr title="Command-line interface">CLI</abbr>
		for building and/or running your program, but you're just gonna hate yourself for it
		<thought>(unless you enjoy the pain of course)</thought>. And to those people, I say that they've clearly never
		used a proper specialised <abbr title="Integrated development environment">IDE</abbr> that made it a pleasure
		to program.
