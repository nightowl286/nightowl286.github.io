		Hello, I'm Nightowl <thought>(god I hate writing about me sections, always feels weird to introduce myself).</thought>
	</summary>
	<content>
		I'm a programmer, and I quite like programming, although there were times in my life when I hated it.
		Overall I think I like creating things <thought>(especially when it's something I think is cool)</thought>,
		and exploring new and different ways to do things <thought>(which tends to get some people worked up)</thought>.

		I think it's extremely fun to try out new ways of doing things, usually I find that most things
		end up not being as good as they could be, simply because they are being held back either by
		tech debt, no commercial use/support, or people simply not willing to change.

		I also run an organisation <thought>(if you can even call it that I guess)</thought> named
		<link href="https://github.com/owl-domain/" title="Link to the OwlDomain's Github organisation page.">OwlDomain</link>,
		of which I am currently the only member.

		The main purpose of the organisation is to create free for non-commercial use software and libraries,
		that focus on being heavily polished, so that they can be a pleasure to use.

		I suffer from a sleep disorder/disability known as
		<link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder">
			<abbr title="Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder">N24</abbr>
		</link>
		<thought>(the symptoms of which make my username quite ironic)</thought>, it makes life both extremely
		painful but also interesting, peaceful and beautiful <thought>(so many sunsets and sunrises)</thought>.

	<wishlist>
		The wishlist is a collection of programs that I really want to make,
		primarily because I think it'll be really cool to make them
		<thought>(even if they do already exist)</thought>.
